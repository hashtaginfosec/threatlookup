# Secret Audit

Date: 2025-10-06T03:57:30Z

## Summary
- Reviewed recent commits (`1554a85`, `b0ea815`, `3488a65`) for embedded credentials or tokens.
- Inspected configuration prompts and README guidance to confirm API keys are referenced generically.
- Scanned repository for patterns resembling common API key formats.

## Findings
No secrets or hard-coded credentials were identified in the project history or current files. All API references use placeholder text instructing users to supply their own keys locally.

## Evidence
- `README.md` uses placeholder environment variable values (e.g., `"your_otx_api_key"`).
- `threatlookup/config.py` prompts users to enter API keys without storing defaults.
- `git log --oneline` reviewed for context.
- `rg "API key" -n` and `rg "sk-" -n` scans showed only documentation and library references.
